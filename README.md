    //Measures Total Sales
      Sales = SUM(Sales_Data[Sales])

    //Measures Previous Year Toal Sales
      Sales PY = CALCULATE([Sales], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(DateTable[Date]))

    //Diffrence Between Current Year Sales & Previous Year Sales
      Sales vs PY = [Sales] - [Sales PY]

    //Percentage Increase or Decrease in sales year on year (YOY%)
    
      Sales vs py % = DIVIDE([Sales vs PY],[Sales],0)
      
    >> Products Sold = SUM(Sales_Data[Order Quantity])
    
    >> Profit = SUM(Sales_Data[Profit]) 
    
    >> Profit LY = CALCULATE([Profit], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(DateTable[Date]))
    
    >> Pro    fit Vs LY = [Profit]- [Profit LY]
    
    >> Profit vs LY % = [Profit Vs LY]/[Profit]
    
    >> Profit Margin = DIVIDE([Profit],[Sales],0)
    
    >> Total Cost = SUM(Sales_Data[Total Cost])

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/JB87dM8/Road-Accident-Analysis.jpg" alt="Road-Accident-Analysis" border="0">          

## Higlights of the Analysis      
Clients wants to create a Road Accident Dashboard for year 2021 and 2022 so that they can have insight on the below requirements-

- Primary KPI - Total Casualties and Total Accident values for Current Year(CY) and YoY growth

- Primary KPI's — Total Casualties by Accident Severity for Current Year and YoY growth

- Secondary KPI's - Total Casualties with respect to vehicle type for Current Year

- Monthly trend showing comparison of casualties for Current Year and Previous Year (PY)

- Casualties by Road Type for Current year

- Current Year Casualties by Area/ Location & by Day/ Night

- Total Casualties and Total Accidents by Location    

## Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) Formulas Used in Measures     

1.Total Casualties For Current Year and Year on Year Growth

(a) Current Year To Date Casualties -- CY Casualties Measure

CY Casualties = TOTALYTD(SUM(Data[Number_of_Casualties]), 'Calendar'[Date])

(b) Previous Year Casualties -- PY Casualties Measure

PY Casualties = CALCULATE(SUM(Data[Number_of_Casualties]), SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Calendar'[Date]))

(c) Year on Year Growth of Casualties - YoY Casualties Measure

YoY Casualties = ([CY Casualties] - [PY Casualties])/[PY Casualties]

2. Total Accidents for Current Year and Year on Year Growth
   
(a) Current Year Accidents Count -- CY Accidents Count Measure

CY Accidents Count = TOTALYTD(COUNT(Data[Accident_Index]), 'Calendar'[Date])

(b) Previous Year Accidents Count -- PY Accidents Count Measure

PY Accidents Count = CALCULATE(COUNT(Data[Accident_Index]), SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Calendar'[Date]))

(c) Year on Year Growth of Accidents - YoY Accidents Measure

YoY Accidents = ([CY Accidents Count]-[PY Accidents Count])/[PY Accidents Count]   

## Key findings      
-  Total Current(CY) Casualties-196k   
-  Total Year Over Year(YOY) Accidents-144k    
-  Current Year(CY)Fatal Casualties-2.9k

# Insights           
## Accident Severity by Casualties Analysis        
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/nkPnMJq/Road-Accident-KPI-Banner.jpg" alt="Road-Accident-KPI-Banner" border="0">          
Accident Severity by Casualties Analysis entails a comprehensive evaluation of all factors contributing to the severity of accidents, particularly focusing on the number and extent of casualties involved. This analysis encompasses direct elements such as the nature of the accident and injuries sustained, as well as indirect factors like road conditions and environmental influences.          

## Casualties in the Urban/Rural Areas            
  <img src="https://i.ibb.co/qJbtD4C/Casualties-By-Urban-Rural-Areas.jpg" alt="Casualties-By-Urban-Rural-Areas" border="0">       
There is a higher risk of casualties in urban areas compared to rural areas. This is likely due to a combination of factors, including population density, traffic volume, and speed.    
  
 ## Casualties By Vehicle           
  <img src="https://i.ibb.co/mSQHyzM/Casualties-By-Vehicle-Type.jpg" alt="Casualties-By-Vehicle-Type" border="0">          
  Car recorded the highest number of casualties with a total of 155804.Insights on road fatalities by vehicle type reveal cars as the most lethal, likely due to their size, speed, and limited protection for cyclists. Bikes follow closely behind in fatalities. Trucks, driven by experienced professionals, are least involved in fatal crashes. Casualties vary based on factors like speed limits, road type, and safety features, such as airbags and seatbelts.                   

## Current-Year-vs-Previous-Year-Casualties-Monthly-Trend       
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/HYzdGjK/Current-Year-vs-Previous-Year-Casulaties-Monthly-Trend.jpg" alt="Current-Year-vs-Previous-Year-Casulaties-Monthly-Trend" border="0">               

November recorded the highest number of casualties with a record of 20975 in 2021 as compared with 18489 in 2022. The largest discrepancy between CY and PY casualties occurs in April and May, possibly attributed to seasonal factors like increased summer road traffic. However, due to the limited two-year dataset and significant month-to-month variation, drawing conclusive trends about overall casualty trends proves challenging.            
## Casualties By Light Conditions    
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/1f2gMJG/Casulaties-By-Light-Conditions.jpg" alt="Casulaties-By-Light-Conditions" border="0">         
People are more likely to be injured or killed in accidents that occur during daylight hours. This is likely due to a combination of factors, such as increased traffic volume, risky behaviors, and poorer visibility at night.        

## Casualties By Road Type    
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/1qJXg6g/Casualties-By-Road-Type.jpg" alt="Casualties-By-Road-Type" border="0">     
This findings underscore the importance of targeted interventions and resource allocation to enhance safety measures, reduce casualties, and improve overall road safety     

## Casualties By Location    
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/mTZkp0s/Casualties-By-Location.jpg" alt="Casualties-By-Location" border="0">     
The yellow dots represent the locations of accidents.

## Problem Statement                                 
## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements:                                 
-- 1.	Total Loan Applications: We need to calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specified period. 
Additionally, it is essential to monitor the Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications and track changes Month-over-Month (MoM).                     
-- 2.	Total Funded Amount: Understanding the total amount of funds disbursed as loans is crucial. We also want to keep an eye on the MTD Total Funded Amount and analyse the Month-over-Month (MoM) changes in this metric.                 
-- 3.	Total Amount Received: Tracking the total amount received from borrowers is essential for assessing the bank's cash flow and loan repayment. We should analyse the Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Amount Received and observe the Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.                   
-- 4.	Average Interest Rate: Calculating the average interest rate across all loans, MTD, and monitoring the Month-over-Month (MoM) variations in interest rates will provide insights into our lending portfolio's overall cost.                          
-- 5.	Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluating the average DTI for our borrowers helps us gauge their financial health. We need to compute the average DTI for all loans, MTD, and track Month-over-Month (MoM) fluctuations.
